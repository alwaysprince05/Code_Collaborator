        // int num1=585; // here it will print number.bez literally we define value as a literals.
        int num1=10_00_00_000;  // we are always confuse if a lots of zeros is mention in any amout.So in java we got a features where we can put a underscore between no if you want to differentiate them it was easy to count.//100000000. but for the programmer it helps you for the no. of zeros.
