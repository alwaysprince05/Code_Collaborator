// Now we want to store some values so that i can do processing on it.Maybe we want to processing two numbers.But before that we will see how to store data.
// when we use System.out.print it doesn't give the new line.but System.out.println / ln means print or go in new line.
// Note: In java after every statement you have to give a semicolon.Also we don't put semicolon at the end of a block like{},[] etc.bez blocks signifies the end of the statement.
// Inside the block in java we first put the value or put the type and then we put the name then we assigned the value. note: = is called assigment operator be we are assiging the value.it will take the value from R.H.S & assigned the value from L.H.S example- int num = 3;
