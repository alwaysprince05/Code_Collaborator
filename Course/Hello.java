// here i will create a very simple file which will print Hello world.thats how we will start the programming language irrespective of which language learning the first thing we do is print hello world.
// Print hello world in python,js we write only one line.So may be Java is not famous for simplicity at start.But when we built a bigger project Java is much more structured as compare to other languages.
// if you want to just experiment with java if you want to test some coder or stuff we have an option which was introduced in Java 9. In java 9 you can write your code in one line you can get the output.We have the concept of jshell in java so it was introduced in java 9 as I mentioned. When we type the jshell in terminal it will give you jshell> prompt.here j means java.
// whenever in java if you want to do something there is a concept called Methods using which you can do something.
// if you want to print something in java there is a method that 
// System.out.println(); , semicolon is must in java.
// if you want to work with a text you have to put that in double quote.like System.out.println("Hello world"); We are able to do this with the help of jshell. It will print on jshell.
// When you work with the java files bez this is how you build a project.jshell is not to build projects it is just for the experiment.
// whenever you have to write a code-you have to compile the code -using javac&mention the file name.and then you can run the code.
// jshell says you just pass the statement i will work.
//Q) HOW JAVA WORKS? Go in notebook.
class Hello
{
public static void main(String a[])
{
    System.out.print("Hello world");
}
}
